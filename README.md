# Usage

You can find any CTF or Vulnerable Target template that I've written in this repository. Using the [Generic Write-Up Template](https://github.com/0xBEN/WriteupTemplates/blob/main/Generic-Writeup-Template.md) as an example:
* You can download the markdown file and get to work
* Fill out the sections with the indicated steps
* Code fences, formating, whitespace, etc. have already been added for you
* Suggested commands and documentation steps are available in the template
* You can remove sections from the template as needed
  * For example, not using persistence on the target? Remove the section.
  * Working on a single target and not worried about routes / ping sweeps? Remove the section(s).
